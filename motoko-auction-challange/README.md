## 🧙 What's This Sorcery?  
This is a decentralized auction system built on the Internet Computer (ICP) using **Motoko** - spicy! 🌶️  

It lets you:  
- Create auctions with **secret reserve prices** (cue dramatic music 🎻)  
- Bid against strangers (or frenemies)  
- Watch timers auto-close auctions (⌛ *tick-tock intensifies*)  
- Check if you won... or if the auction died of loneliness 😢

## 🏃 How to Run  

### **Requirements**  
- DFX (The Internet Computer's magic wand)  
- A terminal window (preferably dark mode for hacker vibes 🕶️)  

### **Steps**  
1. Clone this repo like you're stealing the Declaration of Independence:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/motoko-auction-challange
   cd motoko-auction-challange
   ```

2. Start your local ICP blockchain:  
   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

3. Deploy the canister (wave your wand):  
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

4. **Let's Auction!**  
```bash
# Create auction (Lasts 60 seconds)
dfx canister call auction_dapp createAuction '("Rare CryptoKitty NFT", 500, 60)'

# Bid like a boss
dfx canister call auction_dapp placeBid '(0, 600)'

# Watch timers do their magic ⏳
```

## 💻 Code Superpowers  

### **Secret Sauce Ingredients**  
- **Stable Variables** - Our memory survives upgrades better than your childhood traumas  
- **Timer Magic** - `Timer.setTimer()` that would make Doctor Strange proud 🧙♂️  
- **Reserve Price Check** - "You thought you won? NOPE." 😈  

### **Cool Code Snippets**  
```motoko
// When someone tries to lowball the reserve price
if (a.highestBid >= a.reservePrice) {
    // Happy path 🎉
} else {
    // Sad trombone sound 🎺 wah-wah
};
```
